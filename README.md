* Full user and group system with read/write permissions
* Ability to have pre-saved locations, to improve geo-coding

* Events include a date, a location name, as well as geo-coded latitude and longitude to allow maps/directions to be automatically created

Designed as a unique and accessible platform as an escape from the limitations and restrictions of Facebook Groups.
